# How to get help

We all sometimes hit a brick wall. This guide will show you how to:

* Get support and help by connecting with other Refinery developers

One of Refinery's key principles is "Encourage and Help Others" so if you have any problems just let us know and we'll do our best to help you. And one day you might help someone else out too!

## Google Group

The [Refinery CMS Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/refinery-cms) is a great place to ask for help if you don't get a response on Gitter. Your first message may take a short while to appear, as all first-time posters are required by Google Groups to pass moderation.
